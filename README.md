# An analysis of Kickstarter campaign
##Overview of Project
Lousie play Fever has a fundraising goal where she wants to analyze campaign goals based on the the launch dates and her funding goals.
###Purpose
The purpose is to analyze the outcome based on both launch date and the funding goals
###Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was straightforward based on the questions asked. However, the data was not intuitive and self explanatory. Had the right questions not been asked, that would have created challenges.
##Results
In the Outcome Based on Goals, less than 20% of goals were canceled. The smaller goal seem achievable with 70% successful but as the goal starting growing, the success rate started falling down. This clearly shows that small the goal is more achievable it is. The successful and failed outcomes are inversely proportionate and is clearly shown via analysis. 
In the Outcome Based on Launch Date, the most successful launches were in the month of June and July and then it started to drop. Similar trend is shown in failed outcomes. Highest failures were in the month of July and August. The canceled launches remain steady for most part and seem insignificant.
###Recommendations
A bit more detailed context to the data would have been more helpful. Also, further analysis "outcome based on categories and sub-categories" would have been interesting.
